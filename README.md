A Very Good Project created by Very Good CLI.

---
## What is this?

This is a simple task manager for multiple projects. It's an app that you can use to manage your tasks and projects. The idea is to have a simple way to unify all your tasks in one place, and to have a simple way to manage them. It's not a replacement for a full blown project management tool, but it's a good way to keep track of your tasks and projects.

## How to use it?

Inside the folder `flutter_app` you will find the source code for the app. You can use it as a template for your own app, or you can use it as a reference to build your own app. The app is built using Flutter, so you will need to install Flutter to run it. You can find the instructions to install Flutter [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

If you just want to try the app, you can download the executable from the release folder. You can find the latest builds [here](flutter_app/build).

## How to contribute?

If you want to contribute to this project, you can fork the repository and make a pull request. If you want to add a feature, please open an issue first so we can discuss it. If you want to report a bug, please open an issue and describe the bug.

## Initial model

```ts
class User {
  displayName: string;

  platformUrl: string;

  iconUrl?: string;
}

class Platform {
  // kick-off id
  id: string;

  displayName: string;

  // explanation of how to integrate the platform to kick off (rich-text)
  //? what is this used for?
  howToIntegrateGuide: string;

  iconUrl?: string;
}

class Project {
  // kick-off id
  id: string;

  // platform-specific id
  platformId: string;

  // platform-specific URL (Jira URL etc.)
  platformURL: URL;

  //ex: Jira,Trello
  platform: Platform;

  // project name
  name: string;

  // project description
  description: string;

  // project icon
  iconUrl?: string;

  // project members
  members: User[];
}



export class Task {
  // Kick off creation date
  createdAt: Date;

  // Kick off creation date
  updatedAt: Date;

  // Kick off id
  id: string;

  // Project to which the ticket belongs
  project: Project;

  // The url of the ticket in the platform
  taskURL: URL;

  // Title of the ticket
  title: string;

  //maybe rich text (markdown || html)
  description: string;

  startDate: Date;

  dueDate: Date;

  estimatedTime: Duration;

  // if we implement the time-logger
  // these would be the hours worked on the ticket
  loggedTime: Duration;

  assigned: User[]; // me included

  creator: User;

  completed: boolean;

  // the workflow to which the task belongs,
  // each project may have several workflows,
  // a workflow may be the cycle or sprint for which the task is planned
  // workflow: Workflow; // a workflow has reference to a project
  state: State; //state in platform

  // ideally we should find a way to unify
  // priorities across the different tasks providers
  priority: Priority; //maybe a float
}

```

## Getting Started üöÄ

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Blueprint works on iOS, Android, Web, and Windows._

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:blueprint/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ l10n
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_en.arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "es",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Contador",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Texto mostrado en la AppBar de la p√°gina del contador"
    }
}
```
